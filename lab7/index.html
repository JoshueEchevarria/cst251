    <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
    <p>This lab reinforced everything we've learned so far plus the addition
      of CSS design. In Lab 6 we were introduced to CSS but in this lab
      we got to really focus on the code and design it how we wanted.<p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>It's difficult navigating between the HTML and CSS and figuring out
      where any hiccups are but with practice it will get easier. Seeing last
      lecture it was difficult to wrap my head around CSS id and class but
      using it myself and seeing how it works helped me a lot. </P>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I'm very pleased with the results of how this page looks, especially
      from the grayness that was Lab 7. This is the enjoyable part of design
      that I really like, picking the colors and fonts and images.</p>
