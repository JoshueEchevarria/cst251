	<h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
	<br><p>This lab was to reinforce everything we've learned so far plus more! We
	learned how to input HTMl to create forms and different components of forms.
	We're also cetting into CSS, the style of webpages. </p>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
	<p>We had to go through this lab very slowly to input all the code of forms
		correctly. A lot of it was inputting then testing in Browser. One difficulty I <head>
			was the putting of div code. It moves with the parameters of the page when I
			thought it's supposed to wrap around the text and be stagnant. I'm going
			to ask Wes about this in class tomorrow.

	<h2>Results</h2>
	The results are successful as you can see. Still questioning the div formatting
	but I think its working as its supposed to.
