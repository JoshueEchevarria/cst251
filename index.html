		<p>Hi all who visit this page!</p>
		<p>My name is Joshue Echevarria (sounds like
			Ho-su-eh) and I'm a new transfer student at CSUMB. I'm also a new resident of
		San Jose, Ca so in the middle of classes and homework I'm unpacking and
	buying things for our apartment!</p>

		<p>In this class I'm excited to learn...anything! When it comes to web design
			I'm at level 0.2/100
		(if you count my days as a youngin on Myspace). So everything is very new to me
	and I'm excited to learn everything I can about this new design frontier.</p>

	<p> Eventually I'm hoping to use my new found design tools to create new art!
		Right now I make art with manual tools like charcoal and acrylic paints and
am looking forward to learning how to express myself digitally!</p>
