          <p>“Things falling apart is a kind of testing<br>
             and also a kind of healing.  We think the <br>
             point is to pass the test or to overcome <br>
             the problem, but the truth is that things don’t <br>
             really get solved.  They come together and <br>
             they fall apart.  Then they come together again <br>
             and fall apart again.  It’s just like that. <br>
             The healing comes from letting there be room <br>
             for all of this to happen:  room for grief, <br>
             for relief, for misery, for joy.”<br>

          To the degree that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves,<br>
          we feel confident and fearless about looking into someone else's eyes. ”<br>

      <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
      <p>This lab we worked with centering different elements, text and images.
          We worked in CSS to do those things, we learned centering is not the easiest
          but it can be done. Some things we had to do in this lab were:<br>
          Style all your divs so they are 30% wide.<br>
          Style your floated div so it floats left or right.<br>
          Style your center-horz div so the text inside is centered.<br>
          Style your center-img div so your image is centered horizontally.<br>
          Style your center-both div so that the image is centered both vertically and horizontally.<br>
          </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>I had a couple challenges in this lab. Partly because I wanted to start a
            completely new CSS for this to make sure I was doing everything correctly and
            not just off to a wrong start with an old code setting. Then when things weren't going well
            I added some of the older CSS code and that helped a bit. In the end though I'm not sure
            how to solve the issue of the images. I tried putting them at 150px and they were tiny,
            not sure if that was how it was supposed to be. Then I was supposed to horizantally and vertically
            center one and it is but it's over the other picture.
          </p>

    <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The results were mostly successful, besides the image in the middle seeming out of place.
            But one section of text floats right and the other is center as they're supposed to be
            so that's a good thing.
