          <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
            <p>This lab was focused on styling texts in CSS.
            This included finding different fonts on Google and adding that code.
            Also changing headline font, color, text transform, and letter spacing. </p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
              <p>There wasn't any challenges, I'm getting used to creating html code
              so far and including CSS. In help with text transform I used w3 schools
              and with letter spacing I went to Chrome and went to inspect. </p>

      <div class="results">
          <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The results were successful. I was able to change the headlines individually
              and able to download fonts on Google to use.</p>
