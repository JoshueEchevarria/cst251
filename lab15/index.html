        <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
          <p>This lab was meant to show us some fancy CSS that would give a webpage a unique look and feel.
              Using last week’s lecture, it was clear which CSS code to use, it was up to us how it would be placed on the page.
              In the end, we were successful in using every unique CSS feature on our webpage.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>There were no obstacles in this week’s lab thanks to us going over the material in last week’s lecture. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>In the end, we were successful in using every unique CSS feature on our webpage.</p>
