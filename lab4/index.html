	</head>
	<h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to reinforce everything we
		have learned so far in labs. We created an html document for this
		page and added images to it with captions. I tested all the code
		in a browser and once everything was tested, was able to save
		all new changes in Github, resulting in everything you see here!</p>
		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>There were no difficulties in this lab as this was more a
		review of everything I've done with a partner so far and all
		kinks and learning curves had been worked out in previous labs. <p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As you can see, all the code inputted is successfully shown
			on this page as intended. Now I'm excited to learn even more code
			to be able to add more features that make a web page fun and interesting
			to look at.</p>
			<h2>Screenshots</h2>
