      <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
          <p>This lab's purpose was to go into more CSS coding and find out more
          ways we can design a web page.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>It took me a long time to figure out how to make the image size
          become larger when you hover over it. I didn't write it down when
          Wes went over it in class and I did not find it in the lectures. :(
          After a lot of trial and error and looking at my notes I was able to figure it out.
          Also to change an element in an element (like this font being green in this div)
          it was a little easier after struggling with image size.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>As you could see I was mostly successful, the only problem I encountered
          I could not figure out what not having the text also increase size when hovering, as it
          was part of the same div.
