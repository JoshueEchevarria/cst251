	<h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to add images and links to
		our webpage and get more comfortable with code. Even more, we learned how to actually make
		images clickable to other links. In this case, clicking
		both photos leads you to two different instagram accounts,
		one for me and one for our dog Lalo.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
	<p>We are having less dificulties as we go along with Labs,
		when we have an issue we go back to basics of making sure
		code is spelled correctly, with opening and closing brackets,
		and image and file names correctly labeled. It was cool figuring out
		how to make images themselves clickable to links. </p>
		<p>I did have trouble figuring how to link back to the Homepage
			and waited after class to speak to Wes. It was some back and forth
			figuring out where in the code needed to be changed for the link
			to show on the webpage correctly.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	In the end the webpage looks like its supposed to. The images
	are sized nicely so that they don't take too much space and all links to
	websites work correctly. Even more I went back to add the homepage link to
	each of the old Lab web pages.
