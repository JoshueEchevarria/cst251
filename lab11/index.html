        <h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this lab was to use some styling code we learned
          in our last lecture, like the sticky "Back to Homepage" and the different displays
          of blocks. </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>There was some challenge in figuring out who to make the nav links to sticky. I didn't
          know if in the CSS was supposed to be labeled as nav or div. Turns out it was nav. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results were successful. I like working the pace we do so we can really focus
          and practice specific kinds of code.</p>
