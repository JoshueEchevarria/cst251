			The first focus of this lab was to make sure we were started
			correctly by having our folders of our labs organized.
			This allows us to navigate with ease when we're learning
			this new program.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
		<p>
			A difficulty Rylee and I encountered was inputting the code,
			it's a lot of things to remember especially this being completely
			new to us. So to remember to put "a href" or "li" for each
			lab was good practice for us.When we slowed down and
			carefully inputted each element
			we were able to see the results we wanted.</p>
	<h2>Results of Our Work</h2>
		<p>
			At the end our results were successful and our page and links
			worked as they should. It was a proud moment!</p>
